Formula:

Information about memory reads:
  Value TMP_BV_32_0
 (4 bytes)
    was read at address %rbx
.

Information about memory writes:
  Address %rbx
 was updated to
    Value (concat (concat (concat ((_ extract 7 0) %rcx) ((_ extract 15 8) %rcx))
                ((_ extract 23 16) %rcx))
        ((_ extract 31 24) %rcx))
 (4 bytes).
